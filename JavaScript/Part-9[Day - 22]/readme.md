Part - 9 of JavaScript Jounery 

Today, I explored DOM (Document Object Model) â€” the core of how JavaScript connects with web pages. 

what i learned today - ðŸ‘‡
ðŸ”¹ DOM Selectors â€“ I explored multiple ways to select elements in a webpage. From using getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName to the more flexible querySelector and querySelectorAll. These help target specific elements so we can read or modify them easily.

ðŸ”¹ Creating & Adding Elements â€“ I learned how to dynamically create new elements using createElement() and add them to the page using methods like append() and appendChild(). These techniques make it possible to generate content or UI components directly through JavaScript.

ðŸ”¹  Updating Content â€“ I discovered the differences between innerText, textContent, and innerHTML. While all three deal with the text or HTML inside elements, each works slightly differently. For example, innerHTML reads or sets HTML tags, while innerText and textContent handle just plain text.

ðŸ”¹  Inserting Elements â€“ Using methods like after(), before(), insertAdjacentElement(), and prepend(), We can insert elements exactly where we want â€” before, after, or at the start of another element. This gives fine control over how new content is placed in the DOM.

ðŸ”¹  Managing Classes â€“ I worked with the classList property, which allows adding, removing, replacing, or toggling CSS classes easily. With methods like add(), remove(), replace(), and toggle(), it becomes simple to dynamically change styles or trigger animations on elements.

ðŸ”¹  Attributes â€“ I practiced using getAttribute() and setAttribute() to read and update HTML attributes. This is really helpful for modifying things like image sources, link targets, or even adding custom data-* attributes for JavaScript logic.

ðŸ”¹  Navigating the DOM Tree â€“ I learned how to move around the structure of the DOM using properties like parentElement, parentNode, children, and childNodes. These help in understanding and accessing relationships between elements, such as finding a parent container or looping through child elements.

ðŸ”¹  Removing Elements â€“ Finally, I explored how to remove unwanted elements from the page using removeChild() and remove(). These methods are essential for cleaning up or updating the UI dynamically when content changes.

Every concept helped me understand how JavaScript can create, modify, and control every part of a web page. Feeling confident about how DOM manipulation shapes the interactive side of modern web development!ðŸ’»ðŸš€.

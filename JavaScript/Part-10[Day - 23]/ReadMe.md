Part 10 of JavaScript Journey ðŸš€.

What i Learned - 
ðŸ”¹ DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself):
âž¡Learned how repeating the same line of code inside both if and else blocks makes maintenance harder.
âž¡Simplified it by writing the logic once â€” the code now looks cleaner and is easier to manage.

ðŸ”¹ Event Handling in JavaScriptâ€‹:
âž¡Explored multiple ways to add events â€” using HTML attributes, DOM properties, and addEventListener().
âž¡Found that addEventListener() is the most flexible as it allows multiple event listeners without overwriting previous ones.

ðŸ”¹ DOM Events:
âž¡Worked with different event types like mouse, keyboard, scroll, and form events. Also experimented with window.scrollTo() and window.addEventListener('resize') to handle scroll and resize actions dynamically.

ðŸ”¹ event.preventDefault():
âž¡Understood how this method prevents the browserâ€™s default behavior (like form submission or link redirection), giving full control to custom logic.

ðŸ”¹ Form & Input Handling:
âž¡Learned how to extract form data using .value and form.elements.
âž¡Practiced using input and change event listeners and observed how input fires instantly while typing, whereas change triggers after the input is finalized.

ðŸ”¹Understanding this in Event Listeners:
âž¡Discovered that in normal functions, this refers to the element that triggered the event.
âž¡In arrow functions, this doesnâ€™t refer to the element â€” it takes this from its surrounding scope.

Step by step, Iâ€™m getting better at writing cleaner, smarter, and more interactive code ðŸ’ª

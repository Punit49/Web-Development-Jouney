Part 11 of JavaScript Journey 🚀.



I built a “Memory Sequence Game” (Simon Game 🎮) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project really helped me connect the dots between DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic.



Here’s what I learned while working on it 👇



➞ Used addEventListener to detect both keyboard and click events.



➞ Implemented a flash effect to show patterns using classList.toggle() and setTimeout().



➞ Stored game sequences in arrays (randNumArray and userClickArray) and compared them to check correctness.



➞ Added audio feedback for clicks and game over sounds for a more interactive feel.



➞ Managed game states like start, level up, and reset — all through simple logical conditions.



➞ Explored the use of custom fonts and background effects to improve UI.



➞ Used localStorage to store and retrieve highest score.



It was a great practice to think step-by-step and see how JS can make static elements come alive! 💡
